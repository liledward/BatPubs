# Batpubs - Share BAT Token Publishers
BatPubs is a website built with Django.  It's a community built index of projects in the BAT ecosystem. Users of batpubs.com are free to add and update projects without making a user account.  

**I'm not a web developer.** I'm using this project to learn about Django and GitHub. If you like the idea of this website feel free to join in on the development. Review the code, add new features, or make suggestions. Anything would be greatly appreciated.
